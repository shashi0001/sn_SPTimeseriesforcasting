**ðŸŒ¾ Time Series Forecasting of Agricultural Production**
This project focuses on consolidating, analyzing, and forecasting monthly agricultural production data for various crops using time series techniques in Python.

**ðŸ“Œ Project Overview**
Combined production data from 9 different crops into a single time-series DataFrame.

Handled missing values using interpolation and fill methods to ensure data quality.

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) including visualizations, summary statistics, and correlation analysis.

Forecasted future production for selected crops using:

Moving Average

Exponential Smoothing (Simple, Holt, Holt-Winters)

Facebook Prophet

Visualized model outputs to compare forecasting performance.

**ðŸ“Š Tools & Technologies**
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Facebook Prophet

Statsmodels (Exponential Smoothing)

GitHub for version control

**ðŸ“ˆ Example Visuals**
Time series plots for each crop

Correlation heatmap between crops

Forecast comparison plots across models
